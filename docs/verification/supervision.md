## Native session-start delivery

The cross-harness transport pass ran on 2026-07-17 with Codex 0.144.4, Grok 0.2.103, OpenCode 1.17.18, Pi 0.80.10, and the tracked Claude hook wiring.

Codex command shape:

```sh
codex exec --ephemeral --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message last.txt \
  'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.'
```

Observed result: the `SessionStart` hook completed and its stdout reached model context.

Grok command shape:

```sh
grok --trust -p 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.' \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain
```

Observed result: the project hook ran, but its stdout did not reach model context.
This is the current Grok fail-open limit.

OpenCode was checked in both headless and interactive modes.
`client.session.promptAsync` accepted the nudge in both cases; the persistent TUI completed the generated turn, while `opencode run` exited before another turn.
This is the current headless fail-open limit.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
The earlier `sendUserMessage` counterfactual raced the positional prompt; the current non-triggering `pi.sendMessage` custom message did not.
The installed pi-signed 0.82.0 wrapper repeated the Pi primary extension and session-start path on 2026-07-27.
[`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#tmux) owns the shared-ancestry evidence and authoritative selection-marker boundary.

Current deterministic and live entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The Ahoy first-message boundary was reverified on 2026-07-22 with Pi 0.81.1 and OpenCode 1.17.18.
Marked current operational input and the two exact legacy compatibility shapes selected Bearings, while genuine near-miss captain messages remained real boundaries.
The detailed reconciliation and task chronology stay in the private audit report and PR evidence.

## Turn-end guard

The direct and passive mechanisms were validated across all five harnesses on 2026-07-08 through 2026-07-12, with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 2.1.219 | Cooperative blocking `Stop` guard plus `asyncRewake` auto-arm | A fresh unsupervised session ran session start first, reclaimed a stale dead-owner lock, completed two tokenless rewake cycles with no model arm command or guard continuation, and left a competing live owner unchanged. |
| Codex | 0.142.1 | Blocking `Stop` hook | Hook process root stayed anchored to the trusted checkout and one continuation ran. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.6 | Passive `session.idle` callback | Throwing could not block, while `promptAsync` scheduled one TUI follow-up; headless remained fail-open. |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |
| Grok | 0.2.112 native and 0.2.73 pre-native | Running-payload adaptive `Stop` | Native false-to-true continuation stayed in one process with two model turns and zero resume launches; the field-absent pre-native process launched exactly one guarded resume. |

The Grok adaptive matrix ran on 2026-07-28 with separate scratch repositories and homes, dedicated tmux sockets, one target plus one control window, ambient tmux variables removed, and a socket-bound wrapper first in `PATH`.

```sh
FM_GROK_STOP_LIVE_E2E=1 \
  FM_GROK_NATIVE_BIN="$native_grok_0_2_112" \
  FM_GROK_LEGACY_BIN="$official_pre_native_grok_0_2_73" \
  tests/fm-grok-stop-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
ok - grok 0.2.112 (9bbd559437aa) [stable] native Stop kept one session across false->true, two model turns, and zero resume processes
ok - grok 0.2.73 (9ff14c43bbe5) [stable] legacy Stop omitted capability, resumed exactly once, and stopped normally
ok - Grok adaptive Stop real-process matrix passed with exact target cleanup and control-window survival
```

The same run proved the Claude-compatible Stop entries stay inert under `GROK_AGENT`, the legacy resume carries `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1`, and every replacement root is removed after exact target cleanup while its control window survives.

The secondmate-home scope and manual-repair wake path were measured with Claude Code 2.1.207 on 2026-07-12, when a native background completion re-invoked the idle model with no human input.
The current Stop-owned main/secondmate inclusion and child-worktree exclusion are covered deterministically by `tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh`.
Session-lock ownership in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` is decided against a session's whole contiguous harness ancestry rather than one chosen pid, so the Stop auto-arm reaches its lock owner wherever that owner sits: the outermost pid of Claude Code's multi-level `bg-spare` hook worker chain, or an inner pid when a harness-named daemon parents the session.
Harness identity is read from the executable path and `argv[0]` as well as the command basename, because Claude Code's native installer names the per-session executable by its version (`.../share/claude/versions/2.1.220`): `ps -o comm=` reports that path on macOS and the bare version string on Linux, and neither basename names a harness.
`tests/fm-session-lock-ancestry.test.sh` pins both platforms' reporting semantics behind a deterministic process table and runs the real Stop auto-arm in version-named, daemon-parented, and combined real process trees.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` runs real watcher and arm cycles against durable on-disk state to verify that a delivered reason survives until post-handling acknowledgement and stops replaying after acknowledgement, while an unrelated queue append cannot make a watcher cycle that delivered nothing look successful.
The same suite ingests a keyed remote-secondmate parent reply through the real adapter, establishes the incremental OPEN DECISIONS cursor, interrupts supervision, and proves re-arm replays every unacknowledged queue row plus the still-open decision through the ordinary drain path.
It also covers decision-only recovery, interrupted handling, handling-window generation reuse, non-fatal moved-generation acknowledgement with sequence-bounded consumption, and a persistent successor remaining live after recovery is acknowledged.
### Pi rearm follow-up storm regression (2026-08-20)

A live Pi restart is still necessary after this fix lands: the already-enqueued Pi follow-up messages are outside Firstmate's durable wake queue, and the current Pi process has already loaded the old extension code.
The restart should happen only after the landed extension fix is available, and this verification did not perform that restart.
Validation limits are up front: one combined four-suite runner invocation had an intermittent `tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` failure that did not reproduce in immediate direct and single-runner reruns, and `tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh` self-skipped because `tsc` is absent in this worktree.
`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` verified that a quiet Pi `check: rearm-resurface` continuity handoff — one where `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh --captain-work-pending` reports an empty durable wake queue, no open decisions, and no unread informational status lines — produces zero follow-ups across repeated child-close cycles, while real `signal`, `stale`, `check`, `heartbeat`, queued recovery, open-decision, and unread-note re-arm reasons still deliver exactly once through the real drain peek.
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` verified that repeated healthy Pi `agent_settled` turn boundaries remain silent while unhealthy boundaries still inject one bounded guard follow-up.
Acceptance criteria for that regression were: stop Pi follow-up storms from empty `check: rearm-resurface` recovery handoffs, preserve exactly-one delivery for real durable wake rows and explicit failure or unhealthy repair conditions, keep session-generation and duplicate-owner behavior intact, and state whether a live Pi restart is still needed for already-enqueued messages.
The focused command `tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` exited 0 and included these new pass lines:

```text
ok - Pi empty rearm-resurface cycles stay silent while a successor remains owned
ok - Pi real signal, stale, check, heartbeat, queued recovery, open-decision, and unread-note reasons still deliver once
ok - Pi session transitions use a generation owner across /new /resume /fork, stale callbacks, and quit
```

The focused command `tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` exited 0 and included these pass lines:

```text
ok - .pi primary extension: no-tool and multi-tool runs each inject exactly one guard follow-up
ok - .pi primary extension: healthy settled turns stay silent across repeated assistant turns
ok - .pi primary extension: delivery failure resets the logical-run latch
```

The focused command `tests/fm-wake-drain-unread-status.test.sh` exited 0 and included these new pass lines covering the shared `--captain-work-pending` peek contract:

```text
ok - the captain-work peek reports queue rows, open decisions, and unread notes without consuming them
ok - fresh-state peeks before the first drain leave the unread note presentable
```

The focused command `tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` exited 0 directly and exited 0 through `bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh`, preserving the shared durable recovery contract.
A combined `bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh` run first failed once in `tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` with `not ok - re-arm stayed live instead of surfacing durable wakes and the still-open remote decision`; immediate direct and single-runner reruns of `tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` both passed, so the failure is recorded as intermittent rather than hidden.
`tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh` self-skipped with `skip: tsc not found for Pi extension typecheck` in this worktree environment.
`bin/fm-doc-audience-check.sh`, `PATH="$PWD/.validation-bin:$PATH" bin/fm-lint.sh` with local pinned `actionlint` 1.7.12, and `git diff --check` all exited 0.

The Claude product live path ran with Claude Code 2.1.219 on 2026-07-24:

```sh
claude --version
FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
2.1.219 (Claude Code)
ok - Claude 2.1.219 (Claude Code) live E2E reclaimed a stale session lock through session start, completed two tokenless Stop-owned rewake cycles, and preserved the competing-live-owner boundary
```

Current entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
tests/fm-supervision-instructions.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh

```

## Watcher continuity

The cross-harness evidence combines the 2026-07-17 live pass with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24, all against isolated project and home state.
No credential material was copied into a fixture.

```text
Claude Code 2.1.219
codex-cli 0.144.4
OpenCode 1.17.18
Pi 0.80.10
grok 0.2.103 (89c3d36fb6f1) [stable]
```

| Harness | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` | Session start reclaimed a stale owner before two Stop-owned cycles, and a competing live owner prevented arm, rewake, epoch write, or lock replacement. |
| Codex | `FM_CODEX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-codex-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | The one-second foreground checkpoint returned without switching to the arm wrapper. |
| OpenCode | `FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | A verified successor existed before prompt handling, with no model re-arm or turn-end fallback. |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |
| Grok | `FM_GROK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-grok-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | Native task completion surfaced the actionable close and the cycle ledger recorded `reason=actionable-signal`. |

Pi 0.81.1 repeated the continuity and clean-exit lifecycle on 2026-07-23 after the Calm presentation changes.

Pi same-process session-transition ownership was verified on 2026-07-27 against the tracked extension with a faithful in-process factory rebind (module cache retained, real arm children):

```sh
pi --version
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: after ordinary `session_shutdown` for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, plus same-instance shutdown-plus-start, the replacement generation armed again without a Pi restart and without the `watcher: not armed - Pi session is shutting down` refusal.
Stale prior-generation tool callbacks could not mutate the active child, repeated transitions kept exactly one live arm cycle, and terminal `quit` still refused late rearm.
Plain Pi and pi-signed share the same tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` path, so both inherit the generation owner; other primary harnesses are not applicable because they do not use this Pi extension lifecycle.

Deterministic entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh
tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh
tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
```

## Wedge-alarm channels

The two real notification channels were bounded manually on 2026-07-10 on macOS 26.5.2 with Herdr 0.7.3.
Automated suites never execute these real notification commands.

Argv-safe Notification Center command:

```sh
/usr/bin/osascript \
  -e 'on run argv' \
  -e 'display notification (item 1 of argv) with title "FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE" sound name "Basso"' \
  -e 'end run' \
  'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)'
```

Observed output: no stdout, exit 0, and one banner with the supplied body.

Herdr command:

```sh
herdr notification show 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE' \
  --body 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)' \
  --sound request
```

Observed output:

```json
{"id":"cli:notification:show","result":{"reason":"shown","shown":true,"type":"notification_show"}}
```

The safe command-channel contract is covered without a notification by `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh`: the summary reaches both `$1` and stdin, every channel is process-group bounded, and a failed channel falls through.
